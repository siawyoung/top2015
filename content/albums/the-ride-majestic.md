Metal (Melodic death)

It's Soilwork's tenth full-length album and they show absolutely no signs of slowing down. Brutal blast beats and soaring solos are all on display, and while they won't win any points for concept, it's nice to have an album where you can just sit back and enjoy letting your metaphorical shit be beaten out of you without thinking too much.

If you enjoy this, fellow veteran metallers Paradise Lost's album The Plague Within, also released this year, is worth checking out too.
