Rock (Alternative, Grunge)

It's funny that the album starts off with "Keep your beady eyes on me" because I knew Wolf Alice as the band with the album whose cover was a naked female torso (Blush EP - the songs were also really good too, just saying).

Their music is a slickly-produced veneer over some troubled lyrics, which is such a drastic departure from their earlier EPs that you'd think we were raising lion cubs here - cutesy one moment, and having your guts for lunch the next. You're a Germ is about a boy who at first seems like a cool guy:

>Georgie rides a bike

> To pick her up from school

> He likes her cause she’s pure

>She likes him cause she's heard he’s cool

Oh wait, he's actually a creep:

>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

>You ain’t going to heaven

>‘Cause I'm draggin' you down to hell

>Where's mum and dad so you can tell them?

>You’re a dodgy fucker as well

Damn, that escalated quickly.

Musically wise, the album is unpredictable enough to keep you listening. They've been touring for a while with their previous EPs as material, but this debut album takes it to the next level. Watch the riffs on Giant Peach (Roald Dahl?) go...

>I don't tell lies no more, you know

>I just don't tell the truth

>I don't know what I'm looking for, you know

>But I'm not looking for proof
