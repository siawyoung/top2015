Pop/Rock (Psychedelic, Garage)

The lead single Multi-Love actually appeared on my radar long before I actually bothered to check out the rest of the album. I added the song on a whim because it was so different from what I heard before - this was back when I was still using Rdio (R.I.P). As the end of the year approached and I began to gear up to prepare this list, the album appeared again, this time on a couple of other year-end lists. I decided to check it out, and boy was I pleasantly surprised. It turns out UMO's actually quite established. Multi-Love represents their most mature effort to date. Well, musically at least, because their lyrics are still... I haven't heard such ridiculous lyrics since RHCP.

>We eat crickets in the future

>Just tastes like “Far-from-home”

>Drink Chicha in the Jungle

>That sounds great, I'm kinda busy, could you call back again?

>Im sure you’ll come back, til then I

>Can’t keep checking my phone

And to know why, and why the album name is Multi-Love, it's because the album was inspired by a [failed polyamorous relationship between UMO's Ruban Nielson, his wife Jenny, and a young woman called "Laura"](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/09/unknown-mortal-orchestra-interview-multi-love-three-way-relationship). Wow.

Man, can't get over Necessary Evil's bassline. Kinda has that John Paul Jones/Kashmir-kinda vibe going for it, you know what I mean?
