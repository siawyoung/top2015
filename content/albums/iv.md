Rock/Metal (Post, Instrumental)

Post rock is one of those that I like to call an "international genre" - you can find great examples of it from all around the world (black metal is another such genre). Toundra hails from Madrid (and another post-rock band on this list, April Rain, is from St. Petersburg). I really like Toundra's style - it's heavier than usual and chokeful of good riffs and breakdowns to keep me occupied. Notably, MRWING is only 2 minutes but the way it segues from Kitsune and, just swelling and coming into its own before dying away and giving way to Oro Rojo - just perfect.
