House (Deep)

The sombre, grey production just works so well in setting the mood for the album, and the guitars and vocals by Tow Howie add a lot of value into what would otherwise be "just another" deep house cut. The opening track kills, while some other tracks on the album (Tearing Me Up, Writing's On The Wall) sound like they could've come from a recent Above & Beyond album (it's a compliment). And the photographer in me is just all: "Nice album cover, man".
