Metal (Stoner, Psychedelic, Sludge)

S Class

All but one of the songs in this album is longer than 10 minutes (and Deadweight's no deadweight either, clocking in at 9:28). Don't let that put you off though - oh who am I kidding, if you're into progressive, this is terrific news. Seriously though, this album is one of my overall top picks of the year; I was hooked on first listen and it just keeps giving. Listen to that first two minutes of Compendium - it's enough to make 2015's Mastodon wish they were still living in 2006.
