Dr. Dre did a great job keeping the album off the interwebs, so you'd probably have to buy it off iTunes (or get it through some other means) if you want to listen to it. You should, because damn, this is some good shit. Production-wise it's as good as anything I've heard - ever. And it's a huge relief, really, because of all the hype that's been surrounding Detox, 11 years in the making, before being scraped and this taking its place as its spiritual successor (only Chinese Democracy approaches it in hype, and that was such a crushing disappointment smh).

Just go listen to it. Please. It's really good.

>Fear, fear's a powerful thing. I mean it's got a lot of firepower. If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you, that's very powerful. I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy, just to do as well as the next guy. And to do better than the next guy, I had to just kill. And you know, to a certain extent, that's still with me in how I work, you know, I just... go in
