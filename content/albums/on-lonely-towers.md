Metal (Melodic Death, Progressive, Folk, Power)

Howl starts off as typical melodic death, then becomes kinda power, and then all of a sudden you have this really doom breakdown, before resuming the power-crusade-y chorus. This gives you an inkling as to what to expect on the rest of this salad of an album, the variety of styles of which still comes together to give a really enjoyable listen.
