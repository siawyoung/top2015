Pop (Indie, Alternative)

Pop albums are not particularly known for being consistent - think of them as carriers for their precious cargo (the singles). On Dopamine though, almost every song is strong, which really surprised me (in a fuzzy, pleasant way). In fact, American Money is my overall top favourite (it has this Lana Del Rey vibe to it which I really like) - and it's not a single.

>And we got caught in the storm

>You started flying the kite

>At the end was the key to my heart

>You were my lover for life

(And what's up with the Ø? First MØ, now this. It's almost like the pop version of ö.)
