I actually wanted to not like this album - seriously, TPAB is by far the most widely lauded album of 2015, and putting it on my list would have seemed too bandwagon-ey. But I can't, because this album is just too good to ignore. I won't pretend like I care a whole lot about how timely it is, in light of recent developments in the United States. I do care, in a detached manner, but it's not my battle to fight.

All good stuff - that outro on King Kunta... man just channeling that Outkast. Notably, Obama chose How Much a Dollar Cost as his favourite song of the year. Says something, huh?

For Free?, King Kunta, Hood Politics, Complexion (A Zulu Love), The Blacker The Berry, i, Mortal Man
