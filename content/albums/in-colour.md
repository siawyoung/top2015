Electronic (UK Bass, Experimental)

S Class

This is an album by an extraordinarily talented musician. That the musician turns to be Jamie xx of The xx fame... I can only say, well. Only he can make a steel drum lead sound melancholic and get away with it. Six years worth of material, and I'm still hearing something new everytime I listen to it. Only thing is, you listen to this and you wonder, if he's been at it all this while he was in The xx, why was Coexist so disappointing...?
