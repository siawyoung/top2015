Hip hop, Rap

Return to form. That's what this album is about. Lasers and Food & Liquor II were not that bad, actually, but it just wasn't what Lupe was about. Funnily, I came across Deliver (the lead single of Tetsuo & Youth) while googling for "bassy songs" to test my new subwoofer with. I was like, woah, this by Lupe? I need to listen to the rest of the album, and the rest was history.

>At first I had patience

>But then that patience turned to waiting

>And then that waitinâ€™ turned to wasting my time, my time, my time

>And then that wasting turned to hating

>And then that hating got to racing

>All around my mind, my mind, my mind
