Rock/Metal (Stoner, Psychedelic)

The lead single, Chlorine and Wine, got released back in September, and the album itself was released in time to make 2015 (on the same day as Cage The Elephant's Tell Me I'm Pretty, but unfortunately that didn't make the list).

I hate to make this comparison, but as far as things go, Lore is a superior Purple. That being said, Baroness still brings a few tricks to the table which warrant it a spot on my list. It trades a measure of heaviness for this weird accessibility. I still do wish their vocals were a bit dirtier - it's quite unsettling to hear clean vocals over such excellent riffs. The drumming is also on point.

Not to mention, their distinctive album cover style, the colour of which is indicated by the name of the album (Red, Blue, Yellow & Green, Purple), is [gorgeous](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=baroness&espv=2&biw=1536&bih=771&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwid29uLoYTKAhWFBI4KHbyjARYQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&q=baroness+album).
