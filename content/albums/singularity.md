Metal (Melodic Death, Cosmic)

S Class

If Cosmic Metal isn't already a genre, it surely must be now, because Enshine is it. Their debut album Origin was great, and Singularity takes that and adds a lot of bacon bits all over it (which means it's even better). It's not really power, it's not really melodic, but it has this sound that's designed to evoke grandeur - like that feeling you get when you cast your gaze skyward. Echoes is a great song; really great extended growls. Resurgence is also [similarly celebrated](http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/2015/10/23/top-5-atmospheric-death-metal-songs), and so is Apex (especially that guitar lead that comes in at 4:44 right through the end of the album), but I think the best song on the album goes to The Final Trance. I think I enter an involuntary trance-like state at the 4 minute mark - oh wait it just came on
