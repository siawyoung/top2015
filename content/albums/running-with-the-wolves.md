Pop (Electronic)

S Class

I knew AURORA through a [Christmas advert by John Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuz2ILq4UeA), where the music was her covering "Half The World Away" by Oasis (and quite brilliantly too, I must say). It's hard to explain, but her music hits all the right spots for me. She doesn't have the most technically proficient delivery, but she has this way of singing that sounds more like story-telling than just hitting all the right notes. I think she represents what Lykke Li was *supposed* to be, but never did.

I sincerely wish AURORA success, and I think she will get there and further. Her debut full-length album is slated to come out on 11 March 2016 under Decca - which I'm waiting for eagerly. This S Class is a no-brainer.
