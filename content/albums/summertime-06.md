Hip hop, Rap

I usually roll my eyes when I see double albums, especially hip hop ones. But Vince Staples' debut album is surprisingly focused.  Most songs hover around the 3 minute mark, often lesser, and is enough to say what he needs to say. And he has a lot to say.

>I been through hell and back, I seen my momma cry

>Seen my father hit the crack then hit the set to flip a sack

>I done seen my homies die then went on rides to kill 'em back

>So how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that?

>We live for they amusement like they view us from behind the glass

>No matter what we grow into, we never gonna escape our past

>So in this cage they made for me, exactly where you find me at

>Whether it's my time to leave or not, I never turn my back
