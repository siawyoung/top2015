Orchestral, Choral, Pop (Chamber)

S Class

Sun & Moon is a concept album based loosely around the fairy tale of [The Day Boy and the Night Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_Boy_and_the_Night_Girl) by George MacDonald. Get ready to be entranced by interweaving female choruses, orchestral accompaniments, pop sensibilities, and gentle harps. This one is to be experienced, not merely listened to.
