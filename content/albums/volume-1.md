Electronic (Synthwave, Retro)

The album tells a story of legendary proportions - a magic sword that embarks on an impossible quest to save the world from certain destruction... okay that's not really it, but it does certainly sound like the soundtrack to a animated epic ([Kungfu Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg) anyone?), replete with all the epic fighting scenes and quiet reflective moments. Even the track names seem like they correspond nicely to some sort of a chronological timeline. Some parts of it kinda remind me of Justice (especially their second album Audio, Video, Disco), or Vangelis. Anyhow, I'm a sucker for stuff like this, so.
