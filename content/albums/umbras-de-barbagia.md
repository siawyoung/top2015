Metal (Black, Atmospheric)

The album's name, Downfall of Nur, is an allusion to the [Nuragic civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuragic_civilization), which occupied the island of Sardinia between the Bronze age to around 2nd century A.D. The subject matter is intensely fascinating, but [an interview done by No Clean Singing](http://www.nocleansinging.com/2015/11/18/an-ncs-interview-downfall-of-nur-antonio-sanna/) with the (sole) band member Antonio Sanna explains everything far better than I can. Oh, and he's only 19 this year.
