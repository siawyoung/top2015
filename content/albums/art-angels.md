Pop (Electronic, Synth)

The third track SCREAM had me thinking WTF - a Taiwanese female rapper furiously spitting bars, and I wondered if the rest of Claire Boucher's latest effort would be just like this, and her previous albums - experimental and inaccessible. But no, this retains much of her personal style but is a lot more amenable, which is a good thing actually, because she draws from so many different sources it's quite something to behold.

Recommendation wise, Carly Rae Jepsen's album E•MO•TION is (way) less adventurous but otherwise quite similar in style. Definitely worth checking out too - it's on quite a fair number of year-end lists (yes I am still in a protracted state of surprise).
