Trance (Progressive, Ambient)

I've always loved Above & Beyond's consistency, which, given their voluminous output, indicates that they are beyond statistical reproach as far as their taste is concerned. The twelveth instalment of their annual compilation series continues that trend of consistency. Volume 11 was probably one of my, if not the, most-played electronic albums of the past year (just listen to the first three tracks in succession - just pure nirvana).

As a testament to their brilliance, Thomas Schwartz and Fausto Fanizza, whose crazy-awesome track You Would opened Volume 11, again takes a near-opening spot on Volume 12 with Circles. Counting Down The Days was already a great track on We're All We Need, and it's really nice to see it being taken to another level by Yotto. Zero Gravity is a gem - a collab with legends of electronic music Tangerine Dream and Jean Michel Jarre. A rework of the classic Arty song, Katy, also makes an appearance. Remarkably, the album seems to get better towards the end, with 5 out of the last 7 songs as my favourite tracks.
