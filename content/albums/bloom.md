Rock/Metal (Progressive)

Australia's been on a roll in 2015 with the likes of Courtney Barnett, Holy Holy, Tame Impala all putting out superb tracks. Caligula's Horse is a recent discovery, a band from Brisbane, and while they're definitely not scoring points for breaking boundaries, what they do manage to do is put out some great progressive rock that isn't a wankery show (which is more than you can ask for these days). It's not heavy - Rust is about as heavy as it gets - but the singing is actually decent, and good riffs are aplenty.
