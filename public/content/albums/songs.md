Pop (Acoustic)

Fyfe is English musician Paul Dixon's current moniker, and Songs is an EP of acoustic versions of selected songs off his full-length album Control. I liked Control, but there two reasons I didn't include it, but chose Songs instead. Firstly, amongst some stellar pieces, I felt that there too many weak songs. Secondly, Songs contains all of the aforementioned pieces, and the acoustic treatment greatly enhances them. I'm not sure if I like his voice in particular (I prefer his comtemporary, Tom Odell's) but he has a great knack for writing these dinstinctive, stirring melodies.
