Rock/Metal (Heavy, Psychedelic)

Ghost B.C. (or simply, "Ghost"), is 6 entities - Papa Emeritus III (the third frontman for the band) and 5 instrumentalists who call themselves "Nameless Ghouls". As a band they represent the antithesis of the Roman Catholic Church - but that's about as black as they go. The lyrical material on Meliora is unmistakably Satanic, but the music (as well as their past two albums) is surprisingly lightweight and approachable. How approachable? [They performed Stephen Colbert's show for a Halloween special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMWeIRX-ZHE). Their theatrics and visual image remind me of David Bowie and Kiss.
