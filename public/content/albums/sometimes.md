Rock (Indie)

The music is mundane, and even downright derivative at some points, but her lyrical wit is so sharp it cuts (I thought she was British), and that alone carries the entire album.

She sings about being exploited by the music industry:

>Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you

>Tell me I'm exceptional, I promise to exploit you

>Give me all your money, and I'll make some origami, honey

>I think you're a joke, but I don't find you very funny

or courting at the pool:

>I tried my very best to impress you

>Held my breath longer than I normally do

>I was getting dizzy

>My hair was wet and frizzy

>Felt my muscles burn, I took a tumble turn

>For the worse, it's a curse

>My lack of athleticism, sunk like a stone

>Like a first owner's home loan

>When I came to, you and your towel were gone

or about the eternal dilemma we face on a daily basis:

>I wanna go out but I wanna stay home

and does so with a lackadaisical style that is compelling.
