Metal (Djent, Technical, Instrumental), Fusion Jazz

On first listen, I thought - wow this really brings together all of the good of Animals as Leaders, tones down a lot of the wankery that they received flak for, and replaces it with tasteful fusion jazz-inspired breakdowns. It turns out, after a quick Google, that Mestis was actually started by AAL guitarist Javier Reyes (!), along with Intronaut bassist Joe Lester (whose album, The Direction of Last Things, is also on this list). AAL has always been about Tosin Abasi and his unearthly skill, so it's great to see Javier take a step out and showcase himself.

>Another influence was using the eight-string guitar in a form that is unconventional to the 'trends' or independent of characteristics that are found in music styles/genres that have popularized it
