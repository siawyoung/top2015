Pop (Synth), Comtemporary Funk

This album is just plain fun. It's a little late to the 80s revival party, but it surely arrived fashionably late. There's a little bit of reggae, a little bit of Jamiroquai, a little bit of that gooey messiness you get with a vinyl-only set. It gets weak from track 5-6, but quickly picks up the pace again with the illustrious Slumlord. The vocal production has this murky quality that's quite similar to Unknown Mortal Orchestra (whose great album Multi-Love is also on the list), but overall, production-wise it's unassailable.

If you like this, check out Volume 1 by Magic Sword on this list too.
