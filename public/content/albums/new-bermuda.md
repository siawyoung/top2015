Metal (Black, Post, Atmospheric)

S Class

Deafheaven's previous album, the epic Sunbather, automatically earned New Bermuda listening priority. I initially thought that Deafheaven had faltered a bit, but it began to dawn on me that New Bermuda is them evolving in a slightly different direction than I had envisioned (I admit, I had grandoise visions after listening to Sunbather - yes it has that kind of effect on me).  It's not as good as Sunbather in executing Deafheaven's signature blend of shoegaze/punk/black metal, but it's still got more than enough material to hold its own. Some people had gripes over the placement and length of the atmospheric sections, but these are subjective complaints. I had very little issues on that front. I'm glad they kept it under 50 minutes, too.

I want more of Sunbather, but this is very good.
