Big Beat

I have a weird relationship with The Chemical Brothers. I only like the stuff that they're not really known for - Theme for Velodrome, the song they composed for the 2012 London Olympics, and the OST for Hanna (which is a pretty good movie too). Push The Button didn't really do it for me, which maybe formed the backdrop for the appearance of this album on the list. I still don't like the entirety of the album - but there are a few gems that remind me of what I like about TCB - edgy, catchy beats holding the weirdness at bay. The one-two punch of the first two tracks, especially, just go.
